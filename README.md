Buggy imagines himself to be Gaius Julius Caesar and quotes Caesar’s thoughts publicly as his own at every opportunity.
Proggy joked about Buggy’s behavior and has encrypted the list of quotes that Buggy uses the most in Caesar cipher. 
Buggy is in panic. If you will, help him decipher the famous quote:

```
UDMHUHCHUHBH
```

Write a program that outputs the **decrypted text** for the above cipher.

## B-Caesar’s Knight

**Time limit:** 1 s  
**Real time limit:** 5 s  
**Memory limit:** 256M

### Caesar’s knight

Buggy imagines himself to be one of Julius Caesar’s horses. 
Will he be able to traverse all the cells of a chessboard of size N×N using the knight’s move from chess?

If you want, write a program that for a given board size that gives the answer **"yes"** or **"no"**.

### Input format

The first line is a positive integer `T` (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) representing the number of boards we want to solve for.  
Each of the following `T` lines contains a single number for `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁹) as the size of the chessboard.

### Output format

Output the text **"yes"** or **"no"** (without quotes) if it is possible or not for the knight to traverse all squares on the board of size `N`.
